# codepluginplus
A modification of the TinyMCE Code plugin alerting you when your code may be majorly reformatted.

This plugin builds on the original 'code' plugin for TinyMCE released by Ephox Corp. 
In the original version, when you submit invalid html, it is reformatted to be valid. 
This can cause major undesired changes in your html. This version of the code plugin 
alerts you when your html is invalid rather than automatically fixing it. You then have 
the option to try to fix the html your way or submit it anyway.
